      <h3>INSTALLATION GUIDE</h3>
      <hr class="notop">
    </div>
    <h4> SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Apache Based PHP Server</li>
      <li> PHP 5.3.x</li>
      <li> Mysql Server</li>
      <li> Mod Rewrite Enabled</li>
      <li> .htaccess Enabled</li>
      <li> Cron Jobs (via your hosting control panel)</li>
    </ul>
   <h4> UNZIP AND UPLOAD FILES VIA FTP</h4>
   Once you have downloaded your copy of the software, place it on your desktop and unzip the folder. You will now have a directory with a structure shown below</p>
    <h5><img src="assets/images/dir-structure.png" alt="DIRECTORY STRUCTURE" width="743" height="508"><br>
      <strong>FIG.1</strong></h5>
    <p>Upload all the files into your website's FTP folder. You can use an FTP client like WS_FTP.
    <h4>CHMOD FOLDERS &amp; FILES</h4>
The following folders must have their permissions  changed via FTP (<strong>CHMOD</strong>). <br>
      <br>
This will make them writeable. Normally you simply  right click the specified file/folder on the server side of you FTP Client and  you select ‘properties’ you will then have an option to set the permission  levels that you want.  
<br>
<br>
<div class="info-panel">
Typically for Folder you set the permission level to <strong>777</strong> or <strong>755</strong> (depending on your web host’s settings).<br> 
If you have set to 777  and you find you are getting 500 SERVER ERROR then you must CHMOD back to 755.<br>  
For file, the permission level needed is normally <strong>666</strong></div>

      Once you clients have filled in the quotation forms, you will be able to price them and let them know how much the work will cost. <br>
      <br>
      We have included a default QUOTATION FORM, but you can create your own forms using the easy to use QUOTATION FORM BUILDER<br>
        <br>
    <h4>QUOTATION FORM BUILDER &amp; QUOTATIONS</h4>
    
      The system is made of 2 parts, as follows
      <ul>
        <li><strong>QUOTATION FORM BUILDER <br> 
        </strong>This is what you use to create your own custom forms. You can access this via the main menu item QUOTATION FORMS</li>
        <li><strong>ACTUAL QUOATIONS <br> 
        </strong>These are the forms that have actually been completed by your clients. You access these via the main menu item QUOTATIONS</li>
    </ul>
      <h4>QUOTATION FORM BUILDER - MAKING YOUR OWN FORM</h4>
      To create your own quotation form, you click on the QUOTATION FORMS menu and then the CREATE NEW FORM BUTTON (as shown below)<br>

      <h4>HOW DO CLIENTS FILL IN THESE FORMS?</h4>
      Once you have created your Quotation Forms, then next important thing is to give you clients access to these forms.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DIRECTLY INSIDE CLIENTS DASHBOARD:<br> 
        </strong>Your clients will be able to view and fill in these forms when they are logged into their Dashboard. They will use their main menu item QUOTATIONS<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>LINK TO THE FORMS FROM YOUR WEBSITE:<br> 
        </strong>You can also add a link to your main website like &quot;Request a Quotation&quot; and link it to a url like the one shown below<strong><br>
        <br>
        </strong>
